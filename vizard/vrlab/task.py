        Each task is separated into three phases: startup, running, and
        teardown. (These are inspired by the commonly implemented phases of a
        unit test.)

        Example implementations:

            def wait_setup(self):
                yield viztask.waitTime(3)  # wait 3 seconds before setting up

                yield self.signal.wait()  # wait until some signal fires

        Instances of this task also emit events just before and just after
        running the task. These events can be used to attach callbacks that do
        things like start and stop a timer, or other similar things you might
        want to do during an experiment.
